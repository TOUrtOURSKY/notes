### [Meme][meme]

A **meme** (/ˈmiːm/ meem) is "an **idea**, **behavior**, or **style** that spreads from person to person within a culture." A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices that can be **transmitted from one mind to another** through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures.

The gene has its **cultural analog**, too: the meme. In cultural evolution, a meme is a replicator and propagator—an idea, a fashion, a chain letter, or a conspiracy(共谋) theory. On a bad day, a meme is a virus.

### [plasma]()

![][plasma_img]

Plasma (from Greek πλάσμα, "anything formed") is **one of the four fundamental states of matter** (the others being **solid**, **liquid**, and **gas**). It comprises the **major component of the Sun**. Heating a gas may ionize its molecules or atoms (reducing or increasing the number of electrons in them), thus turning it into a plasma, which contains charged particles: positive ions and negative electrons or ions. **Ionization**[,aɪənɪ'zeʃən] can be induced by other means, such as strong electromagnetic field applied with a laser or microwave generator, and is accompanied by the dissociation of molecular bonds, if present. Plasma can also be created by the application of an electric field on a gas, where the underlying process is the Townsend avalanche.

### [sic][sic]

The _Latin adverb_ **sic** ("**thus**"; in full: sic erat scriptum, "thus was it written") added immediately after a quoted word or phrase (or a longer piece of text), indicates that the quotation has been transcribed **exactly** as found in the original source, complete with any erroneous or archaic spelling or other nonstandard presentation.

The notation's usual purpose is to inform the reader that any errors or apparent errors in the transcribed material do not arise from errors in the course of the transcription, and **the errors have been repeated intentionally**, i.e., that they are reproduced exactly as set down by the original writer or printer.

It may also be used as a form of ridicule or as a humorous comment, drawing attention to the original writer's spelling mistakes or emphasizing his or her erroneous logic. Sic is generally placed inside square brackets "[ ]", and traditionally in italics, as is customary when printing a foreign word. It is sometimes placed in parentheses "( )" instead, though this is less than optimal, as brackets are meant to signify that something was added to a quote.

### [FYI - _For Your Information_][fyi]

FYI is a common abbreviation of "For Your Information" (or interest, in some interpretations).

"FYI" is commonly used in e-mail, instant messaging or memo messages, typically in the message subject, **to flag the message as an informational message**, with the intent to communicate to the receiver that he/she may be interested in the topic, but is not required to perform any action. It is also commonly used in informal and business spoken conversations.
Among Internet Standards, FYIs are a subset of the Request for Comments (RFC) series.

The following description is taken from FYI, the FYI on FYI:
>The FYI series of notes is designed to provide Internet users with a central repository of information about any topics which relate to the Internet. FYIs topics may range from historical memos on "Why it was done this way" to answers to commonly asked operational questions.

### [Long tail][longtail]

In statistics, a long tail of some distributions of numbers is the portion of the distribution **having a large number of occurrences far from the "head" or central part of the distribution**. The distribution could involve popularities, random numbers of occurrences of events with various probabilities, etc. A probability distribution is said to have a long tail, if a larger share of population rests within its tail than would under a normal distribution. A long-tail distribution will arise with the inclusion of many values unusually far from the mean, which increase the magnitude of the skewness(n. 歪斜) of the distribution. **A long-tailed distribution is a particular type of heavy-tailed distribution.**

### [Cassandra][cassandra]

**In Greek mythology**, Cassandra (Greek Κασσάνδρα, also Κασάνδρα; ), also known as **Alexandra** or **Kassandra**, was the **daughter of King Priam and Queen Hecuba of Troy**. She had the power of prophecy and the curse of never being believed. A common version of her story is that **Apollo gave her the power of prophecy in order to seduce(诱惑)  her, but when she refused him, he gave her the curse of never being believed.** In an alternate version, she fell asleep in a temple, and snakes licked (or whispered in) her ears so that she was **able to hear the future**. The connection between snakes and knowledge is **a recurring theme in Greek mythology**, though sometimes it brings an ability to understand the language of animals rather than an ability to know the future. **She is a figure of both epic tradition and of tragedy.**
