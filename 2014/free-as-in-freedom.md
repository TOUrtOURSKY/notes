### For Want Of A Printer
- if a program or software fix was good enough to solve your problems, it was good enough to solve somebody else's problems. Why not share it out of a simple desire for good karma?


### 2001: A Hacher's Odyssey
- the viral GPL: spreads itself to every software program it touches.
- GCC, GNU Emacs, GNU Debugger
- Richard Stallman's Speech
> I do fre software, Open source is different movement. ... like sharing recipies




### A PORTRAIT OF THE HACKER AS A YOUNG MAN
- "It made him so angry." The anger eventually drove her son to focus on math and science all the more.
- "I was weird. After a certain age, the only friends I had were teachers." Stallman was not ashamed of his weird characteristics, distinguishing them fro social ineptness that he did regard as a failing. However, both contributed together to his social exclusion.
- A report: "The Geek Syndrome"
- "My father had a horrible temper. He never screamed, but he always found a way to criticize you in a cold, designed-to-crush way."
- Almost as if on cue, the corners of Stallman's mouth slowly turned upward into a self-satisfied smill. "It was his silent way of saying, 'That's right. You haven't got rid of me yet.'"

### IMPEACH GOD
- "I didn't like the counter culture much, I didn't like the music. I didn't like the drugs. I was scared of the drugs. I especially didn't like the anti-intellectualism, and I didn't like the prejudice against technology. After all, I loved a computer. And I didn't like the mindless anti-Americanism that I often encountered.
- "It's the same reason I never liked chess, whenever I'd play, I would become so consumed by the fear of making a single mistake and losing that I would start making stupid mistakes very early in the game. The fear became a self-fulfilling prophecy." He avoided the problem by not playing chess.
- Members of the tight-knit group called themselves "hachers". Over time, they extended the "hacker" description to Stallman as well.
- Stallman might stay up all morning hacking, or might sleep Saturday morning on a couch. On waking he would hack some more, have another Chinese dinner, then go back to Harvard. These Chinese dinners were not only delicious; they also provided sustenance lacking in the Harvard dining halls, where on average only one meal a day included anything he could stomach.
- Null-string campaign: Email from Richard Stallman:
> I see you choose the password "starfish". I suggest that you switch to the password "carriage return", which is what I use. It's easier to type, and also opposes the idea of passwords and security.





### PUDDLE OF FREEDOM
- "The Saint of Free Software", "Rasputinlike", "a disciple seeing Jesus."
- "That's why I ask that when you refer to the operating system, please call it by its proper name, GNU/Linux."
- "Giving the Linus Torvald Award to the Free Software Foundation is a bit like giving the Han Solo Award to the Rebel Alliance."
- Stallman has a tendency to block out all external stimuli while working. Watching his eyes lock onto the screen and his fingers dance, one quickly gets the sense of two old friends locked in deep conversation.
- In India many people are interested in free software, because they see it as a way to build their computing infrasructure without spending a lot of money. In China, the concept has been much slower to catch on. Comparing the software to free speech is harder to do when you don't have any free speech. Still, the level of interest in free software during my last visit was profound."

### EMACS COMMUNE
- AI Lab: "It was a bit like the garden of Eden, it hadn't occurred to us to cooperate."
- "I may have done a little bit more living at the lab than most peopel, because every year or two for some reason or other I'd have no apartment and I would speand a few months living at the lab. And I've always found it very comfortable, as well as nice and cool in the summer. But it was not at all uncommon to find people falling asleep at the lab, again because of their enthusiasm; you stay up as long as you possibly can hacking, because you just don't want to stop. And when you're completely exhaused, you climb over to the nearest soft horizontal surface. A very informal atmosphere."
- Hacker life, however, was not without tragedy: no dorm, no dancing, no dates, then "I felt basically that I'd lost all my energy"
- "A lot of people were angry with me, saying I was trying to hold them hostage or blackmail them..."
- Over time, Emacs became a sales tool for the hacker ethic.
- The programming session lasted 10 hours. Throughout that entire time, Steele says, neither he nor Stallman took a break or made any small talk. By the end of the session, they had managed to hack the pretty print source code to just under 100 lines. "My fingers wer on the keyboard the whole time," Steele recalls, "but it felt like both of our ideas were flowing onto the screen. He told me what to type, and I typed it."
- Looking back, Steele says he found the Stallman mind-meld both exhilarating and scary at the same time. "My first thought afterward was that it was a great experience, very intense, and that I never wanted to do it again in
y life."



### A STARK MORAL CHOICE
- An unusual message from rms: 
> Strating this Thanksgiving I am going to write a complete Unix-compatible software system called GNU (for Gnu's Not Unix), and give it away free to everyone who can use it. Contributions of time, money, programs and equipment are greatly needed.
- To an experienced Unix developer, the message was a mixture of idealism and hubris. 
- The GNU system, the author predicted, would carry all the usual applications, a compiler, "and a few other things." It would also contain many enticing features that other Unix systems didn't yet offer: a graphic user interface based on the Lisp programming language, a crash-proof file system, and networking protocols built according to MIT's internal networking system.
- "GNU will be able to run Unix programs, but will not be identical to Unix, we will make all improvements that are convenient, based on our experience ith other operating systems."
- "Who am I?"
> I am Richard Stallman, inventor of the original muchimitated EMACS editor, now at the Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT. I have worked extensively on compilers, editors, debuggers, command interpreters, the Incompatible Timesharing System and the Lisp Machine operating system. I pioneered terminal-independent one crashproof file system and two window systems for Lisp machines.
- Created by artificial-intelligence researcher during the late 1950s, Lisp is an elegant language, well-suited for writing complex programs to operate on data with irregular structure.
- Wheel Privilege
- MIT continued giving LMI direct access to the changes. "I was going to punish Symbolics if it was the last thing I did," Stallman says. Such statements are revealing. Not only do they shed light on Stallman's nonpacifist nature, they also refected the intense level of emotion triggered by the conflict.
- The level of despair owed much to what Stallman viewed as the "destruction" of his "home" - i.e., the demise of the AI Lab's closeknit hacher subculture. 
- One of the most notorious of these programmers was Bill Gates, a Harvard dropout two years Stallman's junior. Although Stallman didn't know it at the time, seven years before sending out his message to thenet.unix-wizards newsgroup. _Open Letter to Hobbyists_ had excoriated the notion of communal software development. 
- For a man who had spent the entire 1960s as a throwback to the 1950s, Stallman didn't mind living out of step with his peers. As a programmer used to working with the best machines and the best software, however, Stallman faced what he could only describe as a "stark moral choice": either swallow his ethical objection for "proprietary" software - the term Stallman and his fellow hackers used to describe any software that carried copyright terms or an end-user license that restricted coping and modification - or dedicate his life to building an alternate, nonproprietary system of software programs. 
- After his two-year battle with Symbolics, Stallman felt confident enough to undertake the latter option. "I suppose I could have stopped working on computers altogether," Stallman says, "I had no special skills, but I'm sure I could have become a waiter. Not at a fancy restaurant, probably, but I could've been a waiter somewhere."
- "The commusity reaction was pretty much uniform," recalls Rich Morin, leader of a Unix user group at the time. "People said, 'Oh, that's a good idea. Show us your code. Show us it can be done.'"
- Aware that the job was enormous, Stallman decided to try to reuse existing free programs and tools that could be converted into GNU programs and tools. One of the first candidates was a compiler named VUCK, which converted programs written in the popular C programming language into machine-runnable code. 
- "He responded derisively, stating that the university was free but the compiler was not," recalls Stallman. He had not only refused to hely - he suggested Stallman drop his plan to develop GNU, and instead write some add-ons to boost sales of VUCK, in return for a share of the profits. "I therefore decides that my first program for the GNU Project would be a multi-language, multi-plantform compiler." ... Stallman eventually did this, producing the GNU C Compiler or GCC. But it was not clear in 1984 what to do about the compiler, so he decided to let those plans gel while turning his attention to other parts of GNU.
- In September of 1984, thus, Stallman began development of a GNU version of Emacs, the replacement for the program he had been supervising for a decade. Within the Unix community, the two native editor programs were vi, written by Sun Microsystems cofounder Bill Joy, and ed, written by Bell Labs scientist (and Unix cocreator) Ken Thompson. Both were useful and popular, but either offered the endlessly expandable nature of Emacs.
- "I want an Emacs, and I had a good opportunity to develop one."
- It would also force Stallman to sharpen the free software movement's political objectives. Following the release of GNU Emacs in 1985, Stallman issued _The GNU Manifesto_, an expansion of the original announcement posted in September, 1983. Stallman included within the document a lengthy section devoted to the many arguments used by commercial and academic programmers to justify the proliferation of proprietary software programs. 
- With the release of GNU Emacs, the GNU Project finally had code to show. It also had the burdens of any software-based enterprise. As more and more Unix developers began playing with the software, money, gifts, and requests for tapes began to pour in. To address the business side of the GNU Project, Stallman drafted a few of his colleagues and formed the Free Software Foundation (FSF), a nonprofit organization dedicated to speeding the GNU Project towards its goal. With Stallman as president and various friends and hacker allies as board members, the FSF helped provide a corporate face for the GNU Project.
- The Unix wizards who once regards Stallman as a noisy kook were now beginnig to see him as a software prophet or a software Cassandra, according as they felt hope or despair over escaping the problems he identified.


### ST. IGNUCIUS
- "Some people say to me, 'Why make such a fuss about getting credit for this system? After all, the important thing is the job is done, not whether you get recognition for it.' Well, this would be wise advice if it were true. But the job wasn't to build an operating system; the job is to spread freedom to the users of computers. And to da that we have to make it possible to do every thing with computers in freedom." Addds Stallman, "There's a lot more work to do."
- "Somebody once said my voice was so smoothing, he asked if I was some kind of healer," says Stallman, drawing a quick laugh from the crowd.
- Eric Raymond, "Shut Up and Show Them the Code"
> RMS's rhetoric is very seductive to the kind of people we are. We hackers are thinkers and idealists who readily resonate with appeals to "principle" and "freedom" and "rights." Even when we disagree with bits of his program, we want RMS's rhetorical style to work; we think it ought to work; we tend to be puzzled and disbelieving when it fails on the 95% of people who aren't wired like we are.
- RMS: Raymond's attempt to explain our failure is misleading because we have not failed. Our goal is large, and we have a long way to go, but we have also ome a long way.
- It was the ethical ideals of free software, not "better software," which persuaded the presidents of Ecuador and Brazil to move goverment agencies to free software. They are not geeks, but they understand freedom.
- "Emacs was initially a text editor," says Stallman, explaining the getup. "Eventually it become a way of life for many and a religion for some. We call this religion the Church of Emacs."
- When nobody throws their hand up, Stallman signs off with a traditional exit line. "Happy hacking", he says.


### THE GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
- By the spring of 1985, Richard Stallman had produced the GNU Project's first useful resulf - a Lisp-based version of Emacs for Unix-like operating systems. To make it available to others as free software, he had to develop the way to release it - in effect, the follow-on for the Emacs Commune.
- In a rare alteration of free software doctrine, Stallman slashed the "price tag" for free software. Users could innovate without Stallman looking over their shoulders, and distribute their versions only when they wished, just so long as all copies came with permission for their possessors to devolop and redistribute them further. 
- By the end of 1986, Stallman himself was at work with GNU Project's next major milestone, the source-code debugger GDB. To release this, he had to modify the GNU Emacs license so it applied to GDB instead of GNU Emacs. It was not a big job, but it was an opening for possible errors. In 1989, Stallman figured out how to remove the specific references to Emacs, and express the connection between the program code and the license solely in the grogram's source files. This way, any developer could apply the license in the program without changing the license. The GNU General Public License, GNU GPL for short, was born. The GNU Project soon made it the official license of all existing GNU programs.
- While not religious per se, the GNU GPL certainly qualifies as an interesting example of this "routinization" process at work in the modern, decentralized world of software development. Since its unveiling, programmers and companies who have otherwise expressed little loyalty or allegiance to Stallman have willingly accepted the GPL bargian at face value. Thousands have also accepted the GPL as a preemptive protective mechanism for their own software prgrams. Even those who reject the GPL conditions as too limiting still credit it as infulential.
- Such commercial exploitation was completely consistent with the free software aganda. "When we speak of free software, we are refering to freedom, not price," advised Stallman in the GPL's preamble. By the late 1980s, Stallman had refined it to a more simple mnemonic: "Don't think free as in free beer; think free as in free speech."
- "Just as every writer dreams of writing the great American novel, every programmer back in the 1980s talked about writing the great American compiler, "Tiemman recalls. "Suddenly Stallman had done it. It was very humbling."
- "You talk about single points of failure, GCC was it," echoes Bostic. "Nobody had a compiler back then, until GCC came along."
- Rather than compete with Stallman, Tiemann decided to build on top of his work. The original version of GCC weighed in at 110,000 lines of code, but Tiemann recalls the program as surprisingly easy to understand. So easy in fact that Tiemann says it took less than five days to master and another week to port the software to a new hardware platform, National Semiconductor's 32032 microchip. Over the next year, Tiemann began playing around with the source code, creating the first "native" or direct compiler for the C++ programming language, by extending GCC to handle C++ as well as C.
- Tiemann found added inspiration in the GNU Manifesto: while excoriating the greed of proprietary software vendors, it also encourages companies, as long as they respect users freedom, to use and redistribute free software in their commercial activities. By removing the power of monopoly from the commercial software question, the GPL makes it possible for even small companies to compete on the basic of service, which extends from simple tech support to training to extending free programs for specific clients' needs.
- In the 1990s, GNU also developed a command line interpreter or "shell", which was an extended replacement for the Bourne Shell (written by FSF employee Brain Fox, and christended by Stallman the Bourne Again Shell, or BASH), as well as the PostScript interpreter Ghostscript, the documentation browser platform Textinfo, the C Library which C programs need in order to run and talk to the system's kernel, the spreadsheet Oleo ("better for you than the more expensive spreadsheet"), and even a fairly good chess game. However, programmers were typically most interested in the GNU programming tools.
- GNU Emacs, GDB, and GCC were the "big three" of developer-oriented tools, but they weren't the only ones developed by the GNU Project in the 80s. By 1990, GNU had also generated GNU versions of the build-controller Make, the parse-generator YACC (rechristended Bison), and awk (rechristened gawk); as well as dozens more. Like GCC, GNU programs were usually designed to run on multiple systems, not just a single vendor's platform. In the process of making programs more flexible, Stallman and his collaborators often made them more useful as well.
- According to Stallman, improving technically on the components of Unix was secondary to replacing them with free software. "With each piece I may or may not find a way to improve it," said Stallman to BYTE. "To some extent I am getting the benefit of reimplementation, which makes many systems much better. To some extent it's because I have been in the field a long time and worked on many other systems. I therefore have many ideas to bring to bear."
- As the GNU Project moved from success to success in creation of user-level programs and libraries, it postponed development of the kernel, the central "trafic cop" program that controls other programs' access to the processor and all machine resources.
- Atudent at the nearby University of Helsinki at the time, Torvalds regarded Stallman with bemusement. "I saw, for the first time in my life, the stereotypical long-haired, beared hacker type," recalls Torvalds in his 2001 autobiography _Just for Fun_. We don't have much of them in Helsinki."
- While not exactly attuned to the "sociopolitical" side of the Stallmann agenda, Torvalds nevertheless appreciated one aspect of the agenda's users have no wish to adapt a program to their specific preferences, any program can use improvement. By sharing software, hackers put a program's improvement ahead of individual motivations such as greed or ego protection.
- Feeling ambitious, he solicited a Minix newsgroup for copies of the POSIX standards, the specifications for a Unix-compatible kernel. A few weeks later, having put his kersel together with some GNU programs and adapted them to work with it, Torvalds was posting a message reminiscent of Stallman'n original 1983 GNU posting:
> Hello everybody out there using minix-
> I'm doing a (free) operating system just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386 (486) AT clones. This has been brewing since April, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things). I've currently ported bash (1.08) and gcc (1.40) ...
- By 1994, the amalgamted system had earned enough respect in the hacher world to maki some observers from the business world wonder if Torvalds hadn't given away the farm by switching to the GPL is the project's initial months.
- As far as Torvalds was concerned, he was simply the latest in a long line of kids taking apart and reassembling things just for fun. Nevertheless, when summing up the runaway success of a project that could have just as easily spent the rest of its days on an abandoned computer hard drive, Torvalds credits has younger self for having the wisdom to give up control and acccept the GPL bargain.
- "I may not have seen the light," writes Torvalds, reflecting on Stallman's 1991 Polytechnic University speech and his subsequent decision to switch to the GPL. "But I guess sometimes from his speech sunk in."


### GNU/LINUX
- For one thing, it underlined the lack of an ideological agenda on Torvalds' part. Unlike the GNU developers, Torvalds hadn't built his kernel out of a desire to give his fellow hackers freedom; he'd built it to have something he himself could play with. So what exactly was the combination system, and hich philosophy would peopel associate it with? Was it a manifestation of the free software phiolsophy first articulated by Stallman in the GNU Manifesto? Or was it simply an amalgamation of nifty software tools that any users, similarly motivated, could assemble on his own home system?
- Although late to the party, Stallman still had clout. As soon as the FSF announced that it would lend its money and moral support to Murdock's software project, other offers of support began rolling in. Murdock dubbed the new project Debian - a compression of his and his wife, Deborah's, names - and within a few weeks was rooling out the first distribution. "[Richard's support] catapulated Debian almost overnight from this interesting little project to something people within the community had to pay attention to," Murdock says.
- Shortly after the Manifesto's release, the Free Software Foundation made its first major request. Stallman wanted Murdock to call its distribution "GNU/Linux." At first, Stallman proposed the term "Lignux" - combining the names Linux and GNU - but the initial reaction was very negative, and this convinced Stallman to go with the longer but less criticized GNU/Linux.
- Some dismissed Stallman's attempt to add the "GNU" prefix as a belated quest for credit, never mind whether it was due, but Murdock saw it diffirently. Looking back, Murdock saw it was an attempt to counteract the growing tension between the GNU Project's developers and those who adapted GNU programs to use with the Linux kernel. "There was a split emerging," Murdock recalls. "Richard was concerned."
- In the hacker world, forks are an interesting issue. Although the hacker ethic permits a programmer to do anything he wants with a given program's source code, it is considered correct behavior to offer to work with original developer to maintain a joint version. Hackers usually find it useful, as well as proper, to pour their improvements into the program's principal version. A free software license gives every hacker the right to fork a program, and sometimes it is necessary, but doing so without need or cause is considerd somewhat rude.
- As leader of the GNU Project, Stallman had already experienced the negative effects of a software fork in 1991. Says Stallman, "Lucid hired several people to write improvements to GNU Emacs, meant to be contributions to it; but the developers did not inform me about the project. Instead they designed several new features on their own. As you might expect, I agreed with some of their decisions and disagreed with others. They asked me to incorporate all their code, but when I said I wanted to use about half of it, they declined to help me adapt that halt to work on it own. I had to do it on my own." The fork had given birth to a parallel version, Lucid Emacs, and hard feelings all around.
 - "I remember after Stallman had already come out with the GNU Manifesto, GNU Emacs, and GCC, I read an article that said he was working as a consultant for Intel," says Perens, recalling his first brush with Stallman in the lat 1980s. "I wrote him asking how he could be advocating free software on the one hand and working for Intel on the other. He wrote back saying, 'I work as a consultant to produce free software.' He was perfectly polite about it, and I thought his answer made perfect sense."
- Young wasn't the only software executive intrigued by the business efficiencies of free software. By late 1996, most Unix companies were stating
o wake up and smell the brewing source code. 
- Most of them installed distributions came with nonfree software; with Torvalds as their ethical guide, they saw no principled reason to reject it. Still, a precarious freedom was available for those that appreciated it.
