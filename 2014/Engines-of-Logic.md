#### PREFACE ix

#### INTRODUCTION xi

> Let us now return to the analogy of the theoretical computing machines .. .It
can he shown that a single special machine of that type can he made to do the
work of all It could in fact he made to work as a model of any other machine
The special machine may be called the universal machine.
> Alan Turing, 1947

- the von Neumann architecture








#### Chapter One: Leibniz's Dream 3

- father: a professor of philosophy at the University of Leipzig
- gain access to his father's library at 8 and soon became a fluent reader of Latin
- Euclid, Aristotle
- at 21, his formal education completed, Leibniz faced the usual problem of the newly graduated: how to develop a career
- Paris, Pascal's: add & subtract, Leibniz's(Leibniz wheel): multiply & divide
- 26, meeting the great Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens(Light & Wave), and got a reading list
- Descartes and Fermat: `geometry => algebra`
- Leibniz: `pi/4 = 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - ...`, invention of the calculus

- Table of Approximations on Leibniz's Series
- Finding areas ~ Calculating rates of change
- Integration & Differentiation, the fundamental therom of calculus
- developed an appropriate symbolism: ff(x)dx, f(integration) and d(differentiation)

- asked for the "freedom to pursue his own studies in arts and sciences for the benefit of mankind.", then move from Paris to Hanover

- a universal characteristic, a system of symbols that was not only real, but which also encompassed the full scope of human thought.
- calculus ratiocinator(symbolic logic)
- indefatigable in his work
