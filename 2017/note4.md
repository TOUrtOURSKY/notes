-   [Caste system in India - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste_system_in_India) -<

    :   The caste system in India is the **paradigmatic `[,pærədɪg'mætɪk]` 范例 ethnographic example of caste**.
        It has origins in ancient India, and was transformed by various
        ruling elites in medieval, early-modern, and, modern India, especially
        the Mughal (`[moo-guh l]`，有权势的人) Empire and the British Raj（`[rɑdʒ]` 统治）. It is today
        the basis of educational and job reservations in India. It consists
        of two different concepts, **varna and jati**, which may be regarded as
        different levels of analysis of this system.

        -   Caste, varna and jati
            -   [varna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varna_(Hinduism))
                -   a Sanskrit word which means type, order, or class
                -   four Sanskirts
                    -   the Brah'mins: priests, scholars and teachers.
                    -   the Kshat'riyas: rulers, warriors and administrators.
                    -   the Vai'shyas: merchants.[6]
                    -   the Shud'ras: laborers and service providers.
            -   [Jati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C4%81ti)
                -   a group of clans, tribes, communities and sub-communities, and religions in India.  -<

                    :   Each jāti typically has an association with a
                        traditional job function or tribe.  Religious beliefs
                        (e.g. Sri Vaishnavism or Veera Shaivism) or linguistic
                        groupings may define some jatis.  Among the Muslims,
                        the equivalent category is Qom or Biradri.
                -   varna 只有四种，但是 jati 就各种各样了……
                -   Jatis have existed in India among Hindus, Muslims,
                    Christians and tribal people, and there is no clear linear
                    order among them.
            -   [Caste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste)
                -   Caste is a form of social stratification characterized by
                    endogamy, hereditary transmission of a lifestyle which
                    often includes an occupation, status in a hierarchy, and
                    customary social interaction and exclusion.
                -   这个词和印度无关，印度的种姓制度是 Varna 和 Jati 为代表的。
